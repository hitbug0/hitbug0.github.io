<p></p>
<hr/>
<p>I encountered an error with my Roomba j7+ that couldn't be solved by conventional methods, so I wanted to share my experience.<br/>
The error code was "Unable to Connect (BF0B12)," and the issue was that the app and Roomba could barely communicate.<br/>
I eventually called the support center, but even after 30 minutes, they couldn't find a solution—it was quite a tough problem...</p>
<h2 id="section1">What You'll Learn from This Article</h2>
<p>You might learn how to resolve the Roomba error code "Unable to Connect (BF0B12)."<br/>
Additionally, I'll introduce a good order to follow when looking up solutions for other issues.<br/>
(Please note that this guide may not apply to other Roomba models or the Braava.)</p>
<h2 id="section2">Conclusion</h2>
<h3 id="key-point">Key Point</h3>
<p>Resetting from the initial setup and <strong>connecting to the 5GHz Wi-Fi instead of the 2.4GHz one</strong> solved the issue.<br/>
<br/>
（´-`）.｡oO（ Why does that make it able to communicate...? ）<br/>
<br/>
The support person also didn't know why, but it might be due to interference from other Wi-Fi signals in my apartment building.<br/>
I was initially worried since 5GHz Wi-Fi can be easily blocked by walls, but it has worked perfectly for the past three months.</p>
<h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
<p>I intended to write it accurately, but I lost the notes I took during my call with the support center! Sorry about that.<br/>
Here's the procedure as I remember it. With the Roomba fully charged:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restart the Wi-Fi router</li>
<li>Uninstall the app from your smartphone</li>
<li>Reset the Roomba to factory settings (I'm a bit unsure here, so I've listed the method from the <a href="https://reviews.irobot-jp.com/vivr/manuals/4798372_OG_c755860.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Roomba j7+ manual</a>)
<ul>
<li>To reset the robot to factory settings, remove the dust container and hold the CLEAN button for 7 seconds</li>
<li>The reset is complete when you hear a sound</li>
<li>Press the CLEAN button again to confirm
After returning everything to the initial state, connect to the 5GHz Wi-Fi during the initial setup.<br/>
For precise instructions, I recommend contacting the support center. I’ve included a link a bit further down this page.<br/>
If you try the above method, please do so at your own risk!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section3">How to Look Up Solutions for Other Issues</h2>
<p>It's probably best to follow these steps. You might skip step 2.</p>

<ul>
<li>Common issues are listed, so try these solutions first if applicable</li>
<li>It seems to mainly cover hardware-related issues</li>

<ul>
<li>iRobot Japan publishes videos on various Roomba issues</li>
<li>This also mainly covers hardware-related issues</li>
<li>Recommended for those who find video explanations easier to understand</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search the error code on Google</p>
<ul>
<li>If the issue has an error code, you'll likely find solutions by Googling it</li>
<li>If you find almost nothing, proceed to the next step!</li>

<li>Phone lines are often busy</li>
<li>Prepare product numbers and other necessary information before calling (details are on the page)</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<h2 id="section4">Bonus</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://service.irobot-jp.com/1/roomba_answer11" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iRobot Official FAQ Page</a> has a method for resetting to factory settings using the app.<br/>
This might be useful for various unidentifiable issues, so I’ve included it as a reference.<br/>
The page also contains Roomba Consultation Room videos that are not in the playlist, so there might be other useful videos.<br/>
(However, this doesn’t seem to work for the BF0B12 error since it involves the app not communicating with the Roomba.)</p>
<h2 id="section5">Summary</h2>
<p>I shared a potential solution for the Roomba j7+ error code "Unable to Connect (BF0B12)."<br/>
I also introduced a good order to follow when looking up solutions for other issues.<br/>
I hope this helps anyone who encounters the same error.</p>
