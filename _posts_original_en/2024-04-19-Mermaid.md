This article is about how to draw diagrams in markdown files using text.  
The diagrams are created using a notation called mermaid.  
It's pretty convenient as it can also be output in HTML format, and I use it for work too.

## What Are the Basics of Drawing?
Let's write simple diagrams and their underlying text.  
Besides these, I think you can also draw customer journeys.

### Flowchart
Nested elements are okay.  
Additionally, you can change the flow direction by specifying `LR` or `TB` after `graph`.
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Condition};
    B -->|Condition A true| C[Action A];
    B -->|Condition A false| D[Action B];
    C --> E[End];
    D --> E;
```
```Python
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Condition};
    B -->|Condition A true| C[Action A];
    B -->|Condition A false| D[Action B];
    C --> E[End];
    D --> E;
```
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Action A];
    B --> C;
    B --> D;
    D --> E[End];
    subgraph D[Action C]
        Action C-1--> Action C-2;
    end
    subgraph C[Action B]
        Action B-1--> Action B-2;
    end
    Action B-2--> Action C-1;
```
```Python
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Action A];
    B --> C;
    B --> D;
    D --> E[End];
    subgraph D[Action C]
        Action C-1--> Action C-2;
    end
    subgraph C[Action B]
        Action B-1--> Action B-2;
    end
    Action B-2--> Action C-1;
```
### Sequence Diagram
You can add comments with `note`, and also represent arrow shapes and execution states.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Client
    participant Server
    User ->>+ Client: Send Request
    Client ->>+ Server: Process Request
    note right of Server: hoge
    Server --)- Client: Send Response
    Client --)- User: Receive Response
```
```Python
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Client
    participant Server
    User ->>+ Client: Send Request
    Client ->>+ Server: Process Request
    note right of Server: hoge
    Server --)- Client: Send Response
    Client --)- User: Receive Response
```
### Gantt Chart
```mermaid
gantt
    title Example of a Gantt Chart
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Task 1
    Task 1's Task 1 :done, 2024-04-10, 2024-04-15
    Task 1's Task 2 :done, 2024-04-15, 2024-04-20
    section Task 2
    Task 2's Task 1 :done, 2024-04-18, 2024-04-22
    Task 2's Task 2 :done, 2024-04-23, 2024-04-25
```
```Python
gantt
    title Example of a Gantt Chart
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Task 1
    Task 1's Task 1 :done, 2024-04-10, 2024-04-15
    Task 1's Task 2 :done, 2024-04-15, 2024-04-20
    section Task 2
    Task 2's Task 1 :done, 2024-04-18, 2024-04-22
    Task 2's Task 2 :done, 2024-04-23, 2024-04-25
```

### ER Diagram
```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : has
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    CUSTOMER {
        string name
        string address
        string phone_number
    }
    ORDER {
        string number
        date    date
    }
    LINE-ITEM {
        number quantity
        decimal price
    }
```
```Python
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : has
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    CUSTOMER {
        string name
        string address
        string phone_number
    }
    ORDER {
        string number
        date    date
    }
    LINE-ITEM {
        number quantity
        decimal price
    }
```

## Can You Change Colors? â†’ Yes
You can change theme and shape colors like this.  
Of course, for more detailed information, you can check out various sites, starting with [Junkawa's page](https://zenn.dev/junkawa/articles/zenn-mermaidjs-theme-config).

### Before Changing
```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[Start] --> B{Condition};
    B -->|Condition A true| C[Action A];
    B -->|Condition A false| D[Action B];
    C --> E[End];
    D --> E;
```
```Python
graph LR;
    A[Start] --> B{Condition};
    B -->|Condition A true| C[Action A];
    B -->|Condition A false| D[Action B];
    C --> E[End];
    D --> E;
```
### After Changing
```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'neutral'}}%%
graph LR;
    classDef c1 fill:#eab700,fill-opacity:0.4
    classDef c2 fill:#eab700,fill-opacity:1
    A[Start] --> B{Condition}:::c1;
    B -->|Condition A true| C[Action A];
    B -->|Condition A false| D[Action B]:::c2;
    C --> E[End]:::c1;
    D --> E;
```
```Python
%%{init: {'theme':'neutral'}}%%
graph LR;
    classDef c1 fill:#eab700,fill-opacity:0.4
    classDef c2 fill:#eab700,fill-opacity:1
    A[Start] --> B{Condition}:::c1;
    B -->|Condition A true| C[Action A];
    B -->|Condition A false| D[Action B]:::c2;
    C --> E[End]:::c1;
    D --> E;
```

## Specific Methods for Using mermaid in VSCode
You can preview and output using the initial settings and operation methods described in [How to Convert Markdown to HTML in VSCode](../posts_en/2024-04-19-markdown2html.html).

## Summary
I introduced the mermaid notation for drawing diagrams with text in markdown files.  
It's pretty convenient, and I use it for work, so please give it a try!
