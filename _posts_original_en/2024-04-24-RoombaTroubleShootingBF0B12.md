# Stuck with a Roomba Error: "Unable to Connect (BF0B12)"
::tags{Roomba}::

---

I encountered an error with my Roomba j7+ that couldn't be solved by conventional methods, so I wanted to share my experience.  
The error code was "Unable to Connect (BF0B12)," and the issue was that the app and Roomba could barely communicate.  
I eventually called the support center, but even after 30 minutes, they couldn't find a solution—it was quite a tough problem...

## What You'll Learn from This Article
You might learn how to resolve the Roomba error code "Unable to Connect (BF0B12)."  
Additionally, I'll introduce a good order to follow when looking up solutions for other issues.  
(Please note that this guide may not apply to other Roomba models or the Braava.)

## Conclusion
### Key Point
Resetting from the initial setup and **connecting to the 5GHz Wi-Fi instead of the 2.4GHz one** solved the issue.

（´-`）.｡oO（ Why does that make it able to communicate...? ）  
<br>
The support person also didn't know why, but it might be due to interference from other Wi-Fi signals in my apartment building.  
I was initially worried since 5GHz Wi-Fi can be easily blocked by walls, but it has worked perfectly for the past three months.

### Procedure
I intended to write it accurately, but I lost the notes I took during my call with the support center! Sorry about that.  
Here's the procedure as I remember it. With the Roomba fully charged:
- Restart the Wi-Fi router
- Uninstall the app from your smartphone
- Reset the Roomba to factory settings (I'm a bit unsure here, so I've listed the method from the [Roomba j7+ manual](https://reviews.irobot-jp.com/vivr/manuals/4798372_OG_c755860.pdf))
    - To reset the robot to factory settings, remove the dust container and hold the CLEAN button for 7 seconds
    - The reset is complete when you hear a sound
    - Press the CLEAN button again to confirm
After returning everything to the initial state, connect to the 5GHz Wi-Fi during the initial setup.  
For precise instructions, I recommend contacting the support center. I’ve included a link a bit further down this page.  
If you try the above method, please do so at your own risk!
