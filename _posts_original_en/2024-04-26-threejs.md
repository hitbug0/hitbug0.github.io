# [three.js] How to Display 3D Models on a Web Page
::tags{3D, three.js, JavaScript, Web Development}::

---

Here's a quick guide to displaying 3D models on your web page, complete with sample code. We'll use [three.js](https://threejs.org/). This guide is for those who want to try it out without needing to master all its features.

## What You Will Learn
- How to use three.js (partially) to display and rotate 3D models (STL files) in HTML
- How to change the color and default viewing angle of 3D models
- In other words, how to achieve the following

::stl{
    file: chain.stl;
    camera: [0, -300, 150];
    color: orange;
}::


## Method
First, follow these steps to confirm the display:
1. Download the [three.js sample code](https://github.com/hitbug0/example-of-threejs) from GitHub
2. Run `run.bat`

`run.bat` sets up a local server and opens the page in Chrome.  
You might see a warning, but it's a safe file, so don't worry!

```cmd
set port=8080
start cmd /c "python -m http.server %port%"
powershell -command "& {Start-Sleep -Seconds 0.2}"
start chrome.exe http://localhost:%port%/
```

If it works, check the code and make various edits.  
That's all!

## Sample Code Overview
Here's a brief explanation.

### File Structure
- **includes**
    - **three.js**: Script for displaying 3D models. [three.js official page](https://threejs.org/)
    - `display-3dmodel.js`: Script to call three.js
    - `style.css`: Style file
    
- **stl**: Folder to store 3D shape files (sample data included by default)
- `index.html`: Example HTML file
- `README.md`: This file
- `run.bat`: File to open index.html locally


### index.html
The `OBJ_INFO` in the `<script>` after `<body>` contains settings for the 3D shape files.  
The settings are commented within the code below.  
For color variations, you can use the colors specified in the `name2colorValue` function in `display-3dmodel.js`.  
To add more colors, modify this function or improve it to your liking!
- Red
- Pink
- Orange
- Yellow
- Green
- Blue
- White
- Gray
- Black

The display target can be specified like `<div class="model-container" id="chain-1">`.

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../includes/style.css">
    <title>Display 3D model | hitbug</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="wrapper">
        <h1>Display 3D Model</h1>
        <div class="model-container" id="chain-1"></div>
        <div class="model-container" id="milk_crown-2"></div>
    </div>
</body>
    <script>
        const OBJ_INFO = [
            [
                '../stl/chain.stl',    /* Path to the shape file */
                ['chain-1'],           /* ID of the target div */
                [[0, -300, 150]],      /* Camera position coordinates [x, y, z] */
                [['orange', 'white']], /* Shape and background color */
                [1, 10000]             /* Zoom in/out limit distance */
            ],
            [
                '../stl/milk_crown.stl',
                ['milk_crown-2'],
                [[100, -300, 150]],
                [['rainbow', 'white']],
                [1, 10000]
            ],
        ];
    </script>
    <script src="../includes/display-3dmodel.js" type="module"></script>
</html>
```

### The Essential Part of style.css
The `style.css` in the [three.js sample code](https://github.com/hitbug0/example-of-threejs) contains some code to adjust the display, but the minimal version is as follows:

```CSS
.model-container {
    justify-content: center;
    background-color: #f8f8f8;
    border: 1px solid #cccccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    height: 600px;
    width: 1000px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    max-width: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
    position: relative;
}
```

## Summary
I've introduced how to quickly display 3D models on a web page with actual code.  
It's a good start to try it out.  
I hope you find it helpful!
